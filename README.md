# My-Project
Project Description 

As my project, I have designed and developed an entertainment website which lets you book the movie ticket for a particular show.

Use Case

The user visits the website, registers and/or signs in following the client side validations. The user will select what movie he or she wants to see and books tickets for it. For booking ticket, user has to first reserve it and then again confirm it. The user can also see the upcoming banners as well as trailors of the movie featuring at the theatre.
If a user is not logged in and his session is not created, the tickets cannot be booked. 

Feature breakdown:

GUI code in HTML/CSS

Code for validation is done in Javascript

Interaction to/from MySql database is done through PHP

The database is static



Steps to run the project:

The zip file can be extracted to the computer's folder and the "front.html" is the first page of the project. 

The mysql database is at a web hosting website: https://www.000webhost.com/
